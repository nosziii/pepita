# Advanced Frontend Project with Nuxt 3

Author: Mészáros Zsolt

## Overview
This project is an exploration into modern JavaScript frameworks, moving away from Vanilla JS and jQuery. It focuses on centralizing frontend functionality for consistency and enhanced testability.

### First Task: Framework Selection
Analyzing various JavaScript frameworks, this section discusses potential choices, comparing their advantages and disadvantages. The aim is to develop frontend features in a unified, testable manner without duplicating code across different parts.
